## Train a Smartcab How to Drive

__Question 1:__ Observe what you see with the agent's behaviour as it takes random actions. Does the SmartCab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

__Answer:__

As the agent takes actions with total disregard of its environment, it constantly receives negative rewards but fails to reach it's final destination.

By doing three different trails, we observe that the agent keeps running out of time without reaching the destination.

_Aside:_ We could argue (as food for thought) that given an infinite amount of time in a limited space / environment where the agent can arrive to the destination from any point in that environment, then it would be able to eventually finish.
